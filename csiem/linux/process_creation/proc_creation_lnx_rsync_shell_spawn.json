  "Description": "Detects the execution of a shell as sub process of \"rsync\" without the expected command line flag \"-e\" being used, which could be an indication of exploitation as described in CVE-2024-12084. This behavior is commonly associated with attempts to execute arbitrary commands or escalate privileges, potentially leading to unauthorized access or further exploitation.\n\n\nAuthor: Florian Roth\nSigma Repository: [GitHub](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma)",
