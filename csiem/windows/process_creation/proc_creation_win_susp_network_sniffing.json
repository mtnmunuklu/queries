  "Description": "Detects potential network sniffing via use of network tools such as \"tshark\", \"windump\".\nNetwork sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection.\nAn adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data.\n\n\nAuthor: Timur Zinniatullin, oscd.community, Nasreddine Bencherchali (Nextron Systems)\nSigma Repository: [GitHub](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma)",
