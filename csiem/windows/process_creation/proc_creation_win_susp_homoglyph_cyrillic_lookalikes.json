  "Description": "Detects the presence of unicode characters which are homoglyphs, or identical in appearance, to ASCII letter characters.\nThis is used as an obfuscation and masquerading techniques. Only \"perfect\" homoglyphs are included; these are characters that\nare indistinguishable from ASCII characters and thus may make excellent candidates for homoglyph attack characters.\n\n\nAuthor: Micah Babinski, @micahbabinski\nSigma Repository: [GitHub](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma)",
