  "Description": "Detects whether the image specified in a process creation event doesn't refer to an \".exe\" (or other known executable extension) file. This can be caused by process ghosting or other unorthodox methods to start a process.\nThis rule might require some initial baselining to align with some third party tooling in the user environment.\n\n\nAuthor: Max Altgelt (Nextron Systems)\nSigma Repository: [GitHub](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma)",
