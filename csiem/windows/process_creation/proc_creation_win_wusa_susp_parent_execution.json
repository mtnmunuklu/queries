  "Description": "Detects execution of the \"wusa.exe\" (Windows Update Standalone Installer) utility by a parent process that is located in a suspicious location.\nAttackers could instantiate an instance of \"wusa.exe\" in order to bypass User Account Control (UAC). They can duplicate the access token from \"wusa.exe\" to gain elevated privileges.\n\n\nAuthor: X__Junior (Nextron Systems)\nSigma Repository: [GitHub](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma)",
