  "Description": "Detects usage of Windows Input Method Editor (IME) keyboard layout feature, which allows an attacker to load a DLL into the process after sending the WM_INPUTLANGCHANGEREQUEST message.\nBefore doing this, the client needs to register the DLL in a special registry key that is assumed to implement this keyboard layout. This registry key should store a value named \"Ime File\" with a DLL path.\nIMEs are essential for languages that have more characters than can be represented on a standard keyboard, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.\n\n\nAuthor: X__Junior (Nextron Systems)\nSigma Repository: [GitHub](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma)",
