  "Description": "Detects a suspicious local successful logon event where the Logon Package is Kerberos, the remote address is set to localhost, and the target user SID is the built-in local Administrator account.\nThis may indicate an attempt to leverage a Kerberos relay attack variant that can be used to elevate privilege locally from a domain joined limited user to local System privileges.\n\n\nAuthor: Elastic, @SBousseaden\nSigma Repository: [GitHub](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma)",
