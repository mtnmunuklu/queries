  "Description": "This rule will collect the data needed to start looking into possible kerberoasting activity.\nFurther analysis or computation within the query is needed focusing on requests from one specific host/IP towards multiple service names within a time period of 5 seconds.\nYou can then set a threshold for the number of requests and time between the requests to turn this into an alert.\n\n\nAuthor: @kostastsale\nSigma Repository: [GitHub](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma)",
