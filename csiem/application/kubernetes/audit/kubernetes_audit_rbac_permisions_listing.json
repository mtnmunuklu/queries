  "Description": "Detects identities attempting to enumerate their Kubernetes RBAC permissions.\nIn the early stages of a breach, attackers will aim to list the permissions they have within the compromised environment.\nIn a Kubernetes cluster, this can be achieved by interacting with the API server, and querying the SelfSubjectAccessReview API via e.g. a \"kubectl auth can-i --list\" command.\nThis will enumerate the Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) rules defining the compromised user's authorization.\n\n\nAuthor: Leo Tsaousis (@laripping)\nSigma Repository: [GitHub](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma)",
