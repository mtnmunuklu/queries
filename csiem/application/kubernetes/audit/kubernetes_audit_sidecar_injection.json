  "Description": "Detects attempts to inject a sidecar container into a running deployment.\nA sidecar container is an additional container within a pod, that resides alongside the main container.\nOne way to add containers to running resources like Deployments/DeamonSets/StatefulSets, is via a \"kubectl patch\" operation.\nBy injecting a new container within a legitimate pod, an attacker can run their code and hide their activity, instead of running their own separated pod in the cluster.\n\n\nAuthor: Leo Tsaousis (@laripping)\nSigma Repository: [GitHub](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma)",
