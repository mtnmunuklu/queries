  "Description": "Rule to detect the use of the SCX RunAsProvider ExecuteScript to execute any UNIX/Linux script using the /bin/sh shell.\nScript being executed gets created as a temp file in /tmp folder with a scx* prefix.\nThen it is invoked from the following directory /etc/opt/microsoft/scx/conf/tmpdir/.\nThe file in that directory has the same prefix scx*. SCXcore, started as the Microsoft Operations Manager UNIX/Linux Agent, is now used in a host of products including\nMicrosoft Operations Manager, Microsoft Azure, and Microsoft Operations Management Suite.\n\n\nAuthor: Roberto Rodriguez (Cyb3rWard0g), OTR (Open Threat Research), MSTIC\nSigma Repository: [GitHub](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma)",
