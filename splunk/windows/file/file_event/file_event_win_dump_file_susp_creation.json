  "Description": "Detects the creation of a file with the \".dmp\"/\".hdmp\" extension by a shell or scripting application such as \"cmd\", \"powershell\", etc. Often created by software during a crash. Memory dumps can sometimes contain sensitive information such as credentials. It's best to determine the source of the crash.\n\nAuthor: Nasreddine Bencherchali (Nextron Systems)\nSigma Repository: [GitHub](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma)",
