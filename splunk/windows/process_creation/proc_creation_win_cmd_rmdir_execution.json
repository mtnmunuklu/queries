  "Description": "Detects execution of the builtin \"rmdir\" command in order to delete directories.\nAdversaries may delete files left behind by the actions of their intrusion activity.\nMalware, tools, or other non-native files dropped or created on a system by an adversary may leave traces to indicate to what was done within a network and how.\nRemoval of these files can occur during an intrusion, or as part of a post-intrusion process to minimize the adversary's footprint.\n\n\nAuthor: frack113\nSigma Repository: [GitHub](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma)",
