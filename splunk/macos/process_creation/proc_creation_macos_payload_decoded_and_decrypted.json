  "Description": "Detects when a built-in utility is used to decode and decrypt a payload after a macOS disk image (DMG) is executed. Malware authors may attempt to evade detection and trick users into executing malicious code by encoding and encrypting their payload and placing it in a disk image file. This behavior is consistent with adware or malware families such as Bundlore and Shlayer.\n\nAuthor: Tim Rauch (rule), Elastic (idea)\nSigma Repository: [GitHub](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma)",
