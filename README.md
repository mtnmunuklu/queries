# Queries

This repository serves as a storage and management hub for CSIEM (Cognitive SIEM) queries. The goal is to provide a well-organized collection of queries that can be used to enhance security operations and incident detection.

## Whatâ€™s New

Currently, this repository includes Sigma rules converted into CSIEM query language. The conversion is done using [Alterix](https://github.com/mtnmunuklu/alterix), a tool designed to translate Sigma rules into a format compatible with CSIEM. This transformation aims to streamline the integration of Sigma rules into the CSIEM platform, enabling efficient querying and analysis.

## Features

- **Sigma to CSIEM Conversion**: Sigma rules have been successfully converted to CSIEM query language.
- **Repository Organization**: Queries are organized for easy management and usage.
- **Future Updates**: More features and query enhancements will be added as the project evolves.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mtnmunuklu/queries.git

2. **Browse Queries**: All queries are available in the `queries` directory.

3. **Integration**: Integrate the queries into your CSIEM platform to improve your organization's security monitoring and threat detection capabilities.
